      # NOTE: This will obviously disable all access to your site using anything
      # other than the DNS records with SSL certs that you have specifically set
      # in the Kamal traefik config. You will not be able to access your site
      # using an IP address or DNS record with no cert for instance. This
      # setting is completely optional and just an extra security precaution.

      # NOTE: If you leave this section out, you can still get an A+ SSL Labs
      # rating; however, the "Key Exchange" will have a grade of 90. The
      # testssl.sh utility will give a 100 grade, though. Adding this section
      # raises the grade to 100 on the website test. I can't see any differences
      # on the web reports. The only significant difference in the # testssl.sh
      # reports that I can find are compatibility with Android 7.0; that is,
      # setting these more strict curve options limits compatibility with
      # Android 7.0 (released on August 22, 2016).

      # NOTE: These options are recommended in the Traefik docs, but I haven't
      # found the full justification for these being the "safe" [1] values or if
      # they really need to be manually configured or not. AFAIK, Chrome doesn't
      # support CurveP521 (secp521r1). Your browser can be tested at SSL
      # Labs [2]. It's up to you if you want to chase a 100 grade on the "Key
      # Exchange" when you get an A+ rating either way. Just see what's best for
      # your environment.
